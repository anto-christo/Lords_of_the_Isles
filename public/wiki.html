Every new player in the game is given some gold coins and is allotted a ‘Home Island’ and is given a ship of the lowest class,
which is anchored, at the Home Island. 
The world follows a different Time System called as the Tick. A Tick in the game world corresponds to 10 minutes of time in the
real world.
The world has in total 15 different resource types and a given island in the world by default produces only one of these
resources, called as the ‘Produced Resource’, after every Tick in the game.
A player can perform the following actions in the game:
•	Buy an island
•	Explore an island
•	Buy a ship
•	Send a ship to any owned or explored island

The player has the option to buy/explore an island only once in every Tick.
Click on the Dice button on the Top Right part of your screen. The Dice would take you to any random island in the world, which
is not previously owned by the player.
The randomly spawned island may be of two types:
1.  Island owned by some other player
2.  Island not owned by any player (called as AI island)
If you land on a random island that is not owned by any player in the game, you have an option to either buy the island by paying
a certain amount of gold coins or ignore the island. If you buy the island, it is added to your list of owned islands and any
other player randomly landing on this island would pay you a novelty in the form of gold coins. If you choose to ignore the
island, it is added to your list of explored islands. In both the cases, you can trade resources with the island as and when
needed.
Note: You will have only 60 seconds to decide whether you want to buy or ignore (explore) the island.
If you land on a random island that is already owned by some other player in the game, you have to pay some novelty to that
player in the form of gold coins. The novelty is calculated based on the wealth of the island that you have landed on. Such
islands are added to your list of explored islands and you can trade resources with these islands as and when needed.

For buying a ship, you need to have an ‘Empty Slot’. An Empty Slot is generated every time you buy an island.
To buy a ship:
1.  Click on the island from the Island List where you want the ship to be anchored.
2.  Click on the ‘Empty Slot’ box at end of your Ship List in the Bottom Left part of your screen.
3.  Ships are categorised into different classes based on their speed and cargo capacity. Choose which class of ship you would
like to buy.

For each island you own, you can set what resource you want to sell/buy and how much of that resource you want to sell/buy. This
can be done by clicking on the ‘Trading’ button on the bottom of main information screen.
Trading between islands can be done only by using ships. Following are the steps to trade resources using a ship:
Any ship can load goods only from the island where it is anchored it. In case you want to load from an other island, you will
have to send the ship and anchor it there first.
1.  Click on the Ship which is anchored at the source island (the island from where you want to send the goods).
2.  The main info screen will now show you the ship details and a dropdown to select the destination island (Destination island
can be any owned/ explored island)
3.  After selecting the destination island, click on view market to view the possible resources that can be traded from source to
destination island.
4.  The left table shows the resources that are present at the source island and also being accepted at the destination island.
The right table shows the resources that are currently being accepted by the destination island.
5.  In the left table, you can decide how much resource(s) to load on the ship.
6.  Click on the Send Ship button.
Note: If you send a resource more in quantity than the quantity being accepted at the destination island, the extra quantity will be dumped in the ocean and you won’t be paid for the extra quantity.

Wealth of an island depends on the following factors:

island.
